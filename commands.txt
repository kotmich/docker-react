npm run start - Starts up a development server. For development use only

npm run test - Runs tests associated with the project

npm run build - Builds a production version of the application

docker build -f Dockerfile.dev . - specify file you want to build from

docker run -it -p 3000:3000 <image_id>

docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/app <image_id> - map everything from current workdir (pwd) to /app dir

dcoker run -it <image_id> npm run test

docker exec -it <image_id> npm run test - to run tests with live updating

docker attach <image_id> - attaching to stdin, stdout, stderr on the primary process
Not working in case of docker compose scenario - we are always attaching to main process which is npm.
What npm does is it runs start process behind the scenes, that we cannot attach to using docker attach

docker run -p 8080:80 <image_id>
